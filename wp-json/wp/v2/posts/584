Take advantage of the high cost of weddings and sign up for a credit card with a rewards program.&nbsp;Whether it gives you airline miles or great shopping deals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a Get a grip on the approximate number of guests you&#8217;ll invite before settling on a venue. This will ensure there&#8217;s ample space for your crew. As a rule of thumb, allow for 25 to 30 square feet per guest. That may seem like a lot, but it&#8217;s really not if you count the space you&#8217;ll need for the tables, bustling waiters, the band and a dance floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote wp-custom-block-quote\"><p>Bridal Bliss was the most important investment we made in our wedding. I was completely relaxed because every detail was handled with professionalism and clear, proactive communication. On top of the business side, our planner\u2019s understanding for our aesthetic and vision far exceeded our expectations.<\/p><cite>Elizabeth Anny<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, the different levels of wedding planner service determine the fees you command as a professional wedding consultant. Before committing to offering your professional services, be realistic and honest about your own style, your personality and how much hands-on involvement you\u2019re (really) comfortable with for such an event. Additionally, all communication was prompt, enthusiastic, and extremely helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you sign on clients, be careful how you space out this level of planning. I would think twice before accepting two full-service planning weddings that are scheduled to happen in the same month, for example. Expect to work very closely with your full-service clients\u2013daily telephone calls, frequent vendor visits\u2013so chemistry is extremely important.

Costs per head will most likely be your biggest expense, so don\u2019t be guilt\u2013tripped into inviting people you don\u2019t want to come. It\u2019s the biggest and hardest decision in the whole planning process, but it has to be yours and your h2b\u2019s decision only.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Request an extra hour for cocktails or for your band to throw in that Frank Sinatra sound-alike before you sign on the dotted line. Most vendors would rather secure the reservation than nickel-and-dime you early on (which might turn you off of them). Later on, though, they may be less inclined to meet you halfway.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"When planning your wedding, there are things that are nice to know, and there are things you need to know\u2014advice so essential any bride who&#8217;s lucky enough to hear it thinks, &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad someone told me that!&#8221; If you&#8217;re wondering whether there&#8217;s something you may have missed (or even if you&#8217;ve got everything under ","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1419,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[29,20,22,21],"tags":[28,27,26],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/wpocean.com\/wp\/loveme\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/584"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/wpocean.com\/wp\/loveme\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/wpocean.com\/wp\/loveme\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wpocean.com\/wp\/loveme\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wpocean.com\/wp\/loveme\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=584"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/wpocean.com\/wp\/loveme\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/584\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wpocean.com\/wp\/loveme\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1419"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/wpocean.com\/wp\/loveme\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=584"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wpocean.com\/wp\/loveme\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=584"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wpocean.com\/wp\/loveme\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=584"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
